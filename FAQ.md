# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Payment Security

**Q: How is my payment protected?**

A: We use a secure escrow system. Your payment is held by RepairHub Pro and is only released to the master after you confirm that the repair has been completed to your satisfaction.

## Refunds

**Q: How can I get a refund?**

A: If you are not satisfied with the repair, you can open a dispute. Our support team will investigate the issue and, if necessary, process a refund from the escrowed funds.

## Disputes

**Q: What should I do if there is a dispute?**

A: If you have an issue with a repair, first try to resolve it with the master through our chat system. If you cannot reach an agreement, you can open a dispute through the order page. Our team will mediate and help find a fair solution.
