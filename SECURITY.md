# Security at RepairHub Pro

We take the security of your data and transactions very seriously.

- **Secure Authentication:** We use modern authentication methods to protect your account.

## Escrow System Explained

Our escrow system is a key part of our commitment to security. Here's how it works:

1.  **Client Funds the Order:** The client's payment is held in a secure, neutral account.
2.  **Master Completes the Work:** The master performs the repair as agreed.
3.  **Client Confirms Satisfaction:** The client reviews the work and confirms that it is complete.
4.  **Funds are Released:** Only after the client's confirmation are the funds released to the master.

This process protects both parties and ensures a fair and secure transaction.
